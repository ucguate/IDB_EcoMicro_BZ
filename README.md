Technology Stack

The technology stack is as follows:
HTML As a markdown tool for mockups the front-end.
CSS As a styles and animations tool
Bootstrap As a style library
Jquery and Vanilla javascript
Javascript is used to add the general behavior of the application, connection to backend API and enhancement of user interfaces.
On the backend we propose mysql database management app for questions/ answers scores management and parametrization
API on database backend to be used by web application



Hosting
The application is currently served by Firebase, a Google Serverless service that offers a fairly extensive free plan and its servers are very efficient, SSL certificates included. In addition, it offers us ease of deployment with simple commands.

We are using this environment for development, later we can decide where to deploy on self hosted servers or cloud linux instances. Being a common and lightweight architecture it could run on any common server.


Code

Everything is mounted in this private GitHub repository that you can access here: 


The folder that stores all the files to serve (build) is: exports / exports / *

The rest of the files that are outside are configuration and development.
